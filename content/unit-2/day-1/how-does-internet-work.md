### Essential Knowledge 

CSN-1.B.1 The Internet is a computer network consisting of interconnected networks that use standardized, open (nonproprietary) communication protocols.

CSN-1.B.2 Access to the Internet depends on the ability to connect a computing device to an Internet-connected device.

CSN-1.B.3 A protocol is an agreed-upon set of rules that specify the behavior of a system.

CSN-1.B.4 The protocols used in the Internet are open, which allows users to easily connect additional computing devices to the Internet.

CSN-1.B.5 Routing on the Internet is usually dynamic; it is not specified in advance.

CSN-1.B.6 The scalability of a system is the capacity for the system to change in size and scale to meet new demands.

 

CSN-1.B.7 The Internet was designed to be scalable.

 

CSN-1.C.1 Information is passed through the Internet as a data stream. Data streams contain chunks of data, which are encapsulated in packets.

 

CSN-1.C.2 Packets contain a chunk of data and metadata used for routing the packet between the origin and the destination on the Internet, as well as for data reassembly.

 

CSN-1.C.3 Packets may arrive at the destination in order, out of order, or not at all.

CSN-1.C.4 IP, TCP, and UDP are common protocols used on the Internet.
